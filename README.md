Weâ€™ve created this website to amplify fundraisers by grassroots volunteer groups that do not have access to support from
larger organizations. We prioritize helping vetted volunteers that have been actively coordinating aid and other forms
of support to Ukrainian battalions, people in combat zones and refugees.
