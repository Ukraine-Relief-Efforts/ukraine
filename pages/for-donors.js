                            community donate to Ukrainians in need. In addition

                            coordinating purchases of emergency supplies for
                            both civilians and military in Ukraine.

                            <p>
                                One of our main goals was to make evaluation of
                                smaller volunteer-driven fundraisers simple.
                                Volunteers do much of the work of coordinating
                                emergency humanitarian aid to Ukrainians. These
                                are political activists, Ukrainian diaspora,
                                friends and family members of people requiring
                                immediate aid. They are in direct contact with
                                people on the ground and understand their
                                immediate needs best.

                                As a part of a large informal network of
                                volunteers, they purchase and deliver the
                                supplies like medicines, food, body armor, and
                                first aid kits. All charitable donations are
                                crucial, but please take the extra moment to
                                consider these fundraisers.
