                            <p>
                                Since Russia‚Äôs most recent invasion, friends and
                                families of people fighting on the frontlines,
                                activists, and others have volunteered to
                                support the people and military in Ukraine, at
                                times risking their lives to deliver essential
                                supplies to occupied areas. While large
                                charities will continue playing a crucial role
                                in helping people affected by this war, their
                                ability to quickly respond to the needs of small
                                groups in different regions of Ukraine is
                                limited. Volunteers fill in this gap. They have
                                first-hand information on the most current and
                                urgent needs. Every dollar of the donation to
                                their fundraisers goes to life-saving supplies
                                and services - medicines, protective gear,
                                transportation, and more - making a tremendous
                                impact for people on the ground.
