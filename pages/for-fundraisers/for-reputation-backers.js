                            volunteers. This person could be a local activist,

                            professional. They have to be committed to doing

                            Problem
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            We have many volunteers on the ground coordinating
                            supplies and aid for Ukrainian civilians and
                            military. They are in direct contact with local
                            groups on the ground and understand their immediate
                            needs best.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            The process of getting aid is messy and
                            decentralized. Troops or civilians ask volunteers
                            for help. Volunteers have to find suppliers and
                            orchestrate delivery from Europe into some part of
                            Ukraine. Right now, there is not a better process.
                            Centralization would be more dangerous by increasing
                            the chances of ambushes and putting delivery
                            volunteers and recipients in danger. Technology
                            cannot help â€” yet.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Even still, we can help streamline the funding
                            process to support volunteers coordinating the
                            supplies and aid. So far, fundraising is limited by
                            someoneâ€™s personal network. Volunteers rely on their
                            reputation to secure the funds from friends and
                            acquaintances. Ukrainians cannot afford to donate
                            much, and some funding amounts are much larger than
                            someoneâ€™s personal network can afford. For example,
                            my friends in Kyiv joined a civilian resistance
                            group that needed traumatic bleeding patches. These
                            patches save lives but also cost $100 per patch for
                            a quality brand. To help them, I need to find a
                            supplier in Europe, delivery people, and funds.
                            After the hustle of finding a supplier and setting
                            up logistics through a trusted network of personal
                            connections, I can only afford to buy 20 patches
                            with the $2,000 fundraised through personal
                            connections. The good news is that I get to help my
                            friends. The bad news is that I cannot wait for more
                            funding to come in and later send a larger supply
                            because these patches are needed as soon as
                            possible.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            If individual volunteers get more funding, they can
                            buy more supplies and get these delivered where they
                            are most needed faster.
