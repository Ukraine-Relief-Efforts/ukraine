                            volunteers. This person could be a local activist,
                            supporter abroad, political figure, industry
                            professional. They have to be committed to doing
                            additional due diligence on the project and hosting
                            a fundraiser post on their social media platform.

                            Problem
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            There are many volunteers coordinating supplies and
                            aid for Ukrainian civilians and military. They are
                            in direct contact with local groups on the ground
                            and understand their immediate needs best.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            Often they cannot communicate transparently what
                            amount of aid is needed, where the supplies will go,
                            and what financial transactions took place.
                            Sensitive information if made public can be used by
                            enemy intelligence and result in ambushes putting
                            both delivery volunteers and aid recipients in
                            danger.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            For this reason volunteers have to rely on their
                            close networks to secure the funds. Securing the
                            funds from broader audiences means more supplies
                            purchased faster and more people getting crucial
                            help.
