                            Weâ€™ve created this website to amplify
                            volunteer-driven fundraisers for groups that do not
                            have access to support from larger organizations.
                            Since the beginning of the project, weâ€™ve worked
                            with over 30 people, including designers,
                            developers, lawyers, cybersecurity specialists, and
                            more, from Ukraine, the US, Canada, Netherland, and
                            beyond. We now have a core group of 5-10 volunteers
                            who support this project consistently. Anyone with
                            the skills and capacity to help can join our
                            efforts!

                                        Fundraisers typically demonstrate their
